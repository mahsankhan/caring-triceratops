    "I believe we should consider the possibility to issue digital currency.
    There may be a role for the state to supply money to the digital economy.
    This currency could satisfy public policy goals, such as (i) financial
    inclusion, and (ii) security and consumer protection; and to provide what
    the private sector cannot: (iii) privacy in payments.”

# Central Bank-Issued Digital Currency (CBDC) Defined

[The Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/broadening-narrow-money-monetary-policy-with-a-central-bank-digital-currency.pdf) defines a Central Bank digital currency as “an electronic fiat liability of a Central Bank that can be used to settle payments or as a store
of value. It is, in essence, electronic Central Bank money or ‘narrow’ money.”
It is important to note that a CBDC will not replace electronic money, physical
notes and coins, nor [traditional banking](https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2018/2018-026.pdf). CBDC complements these existing
payment mechanisms, and addresses a number of the shortcomings and [costs
of physical cash](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-hidden-costs-of-cash) and electronic money, as well as financial exclusion and the
high cost of banking. CBDC versus cash is analogous to the manner in which
email complements traditional postal methods and has improved the efficiency
of conducting business.

## Problems with Cash:

• [The recurring cost of printing and issuing physical currency.](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/attacking-the-cost-of-cash) 

[](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/attacking-the-cost-of-cash)• The cost of security and risks of theft in transportation and storage. 

• Limitations during transactions, where both parties must be present. 

• Considerable time and resources are required to count physical cash. 

• Circulation of counterfeit currency poses a continuous risk. 

• Physically damaged currency requires removal from circulation. 

• [Cash usage imposes a regressive tax.](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-hidden-costs-of-cash)
